Requires discord.py loaded.

Changes needed for main.py for use:

Need to add songs to a folder, and then set the path to variable path_songs


Need to set up the bot token in Discord applications, then set it in bot_token variable

Need to set member IDs to the names of songs plus file types in the dictionary "intros". For example, if the file is named "Song", it would be "Song.typeoffile". 

Need to set sup_allowed_users to your own id, unless you want others shutting down the bot.

Sorry if this doesn't made much sense, I'm new
