Requires discord.py loaded.

Need to set the path to song files in Main.py.

Need to add songs to IntroSongs file, or equivalent

Need to set up the bot token in Discord applications.

Need to set member IDs to the names of songs plus file types in the dictionary "intros". For example, if the file is named "Song", it would be "Song.typeoffile". 

Need to set sup_allowed_users to your own id, unless you want others shutting down the bot.

Sorry if this doesn't made much sense, I'm new
