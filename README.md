Requires discord.py loaded.
Need to set the path to song files in Main.py.
Need to set up the bot token in discord applications.
Need to set member ids to names of song plus file type in intro, for example if the file is named Song, it would be Song.typeoffile. 
Need to set sup_allowed_users to your own id, unless you want others shutting down the bot.
Sorry if this doesn't made much sense, I'm new
